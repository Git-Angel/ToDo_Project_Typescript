# üìù React Todo App

A fully functional Todo web application built with **React**, **React Router v7**, and **Tailwind CSS**, using **JSONPlaceholder** for API integrations. The creating, editing and deleting modals of this application are fully functional at the UI level but those actions are not carried out at the back end due to the fact that we are dealing with a dummy database, hence those actions are for demonstration purposes.


## üìå Features

- **Skeleton üíÄ** as the first component to load the page contents
- Fetch todos from API with **pagination** (10 items per page)
- **Search** todos by title
- **Filter** by completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete items)
- View **individual todo details** on a separate page
- **Create**, **Edit**, and **Delete** todos with modal forms
- **Error Boundary** for error handling
- **Custom 404 page** for undefined routes
- Fully **responsive** design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

## ‚ö† Limitations

The Add/Edit/Delete are not persisted because JSONPlaceholder is a mock API.

Error boundary catches frontend errors but cannot detect failed API calls yet.

---

## üîÆ Future Improvements

Connect to a real backend API (Node/Express, Firebase, etc.)

Add user authentication (login/signup)

Implement persistent local storage or IndexedDB fallback

Add unit tests with Jest/React Testing Library

## React + Vite (Advise)

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react)
uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc)
uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled.
Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts)
for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your future projects.]
